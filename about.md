<p>We are a group of students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic that have set up this blog with the purpose to document our journey into discovering our heritage in Singapore. We aim to deliver content from the eyes of a Singaporean teenager and hope that our insights will provide a greater understanding &nbsp;to not just youths but anyone out there interested in the Singaporean heritage.</p><p>In the age where there's consistent progress, we often forget the beauty of our traditions held up by the strong foundation of our heritage.&nbsp;All content written on this site is carefully crafted from all of us and we sincerely hope that you enjoy your time here!</p>
